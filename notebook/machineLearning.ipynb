    "## Prepare the dataset for training\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to \"teach\" a machine to distinguish between spam and ham. Unfortunately, machines prefer to speak numbers rather than words. You then need to transform the human-readable CSV file above into a format that, albeit less readable by us puny humans, is more suited to the subsequent task of training the classifier. You will express (a cleaned-out version of) the text into a sequence of numbers, each representing a token (one word) forming the message text.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. first you'll initialize a \"tokenizer\", asking it to build a dictionary (i.e. a token/number mapping) best suited for the texts at hand;\n",
    "2. then, you'll use the tokenizer to reduce all messages into (variable-length) sequences of numbers;\n",
    "3. these sequences will be \"padded\", i.e. you'll make sure they end up all having the same length: in this way, the whole dataset will be represented by a rectangular matrix of integer numbers, each row possibly having leading zeroes;\n",
    "4. the \"spam/ham\" column of the input dataset is recast with the \"*one-hot encoding*\": that is, it will become two columns, one for \"spamminess\" and one for \"hamminess\", both admitting the values zero or one (but with a single \"one\" per row): this turns out to be a formulation much friendlier to categorical classification tasks in general;\n",
    "5. finally you'll split the labeled dataset into a \"training\" and a \"testing\" disjoint parts. This is a very important concept: the effectiveness of a model should always be validated on data points *not used during training*.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these steps can be largely automated by using data-science Python packages such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `tensorflow/keras`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The dataset preparation starts with the CSV file you saw earlier and ends up exporting the new data format in the training/prepared_dataset directory. Two observations are in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the \"big matrix of numbers\" encoding the messages and the (narrower) one containing their spam/ham status are useless without the tokenizer: after all, to process a new message you would need to make it into a sequence of numbers using this very same mapping. For this reason, it is important to export the tokenizer as well, in order to later use the classifier.\n",
    "- the `pickle` protocol used in writing the reformulated data is strictly Python-specific and should not be treated as a long-term (or interoperable!) format. Later we discuss a sensible way to store model, tokenizer and metadata on disk."
